## tl;dr

The EOTL garden is a tucked away corner of greenery in the centre of 
Edinburgh dedicated to biodiversity, outdoor education and local community
engagement.

# The green

The green constitutes ~0.5 acres of open space, tucked away at the end of a
residential street. It was previously the home of the Tramways Bowling Club,
who rented the space from Lothian Buses. When the green became available in
2020 we put in a bid to buy the space, in the hope of sustainably converting
the old pavilion on the site to a home and rewilding the green. Though not the
highest offer, we were selected by Lothian Buses on the merit of our project
and their desire to protect the space.

The green is intended to provides habitats, produce food, support pollinators
of all kinds and facilitate community projects. In collaboration with local
community charities, the Edinburgh Nature Network, ERBG, UOE biodiversity and
soil experts, and experienced local growing groups the green will exist as a
self-perpetuating, perennial space filled with native species and amenable to
community engagement.

# The philosophy

Outside of its size and location, the green represents a unique opportunity for
growing projects due it being entirely enclosed, with a single and
controlled point of access. Rather than posing a barrier to use, this in fact
solves two major issues associated with public growing projects:

- That the primary cause of failure is vandalism
- That they cannot be accessed by certain vulnerable members of the community

Our aim is to make use of the green as a safe environment for outdoor community
projects and education, with a focus on young families with challenging
homelives in Leith and the surrounding areas who cannot otherwise make use of
traditional outdoor space.

By facilitating forest school and permaculture activities we hope to engender a
wider appreciation of nature for those who struggle to access it, providing
learner inspired, hands-on experience in the natural environment. Beyond the
green itself we hope to empower community members to take this philosophy home
with them, both figuratively through ideas and practical knowledge as well as
literally by cultivating and sharing seeds and plants. 

# Us

We (Kat and Dom) bought the green in late 2020, having lived in Leith for
almost 10 years. Like many people, we were finding it increasingly difficult to
find an affordable home with enough space for our family and becoming acutely
aware of how essential accessing safe green space is, especially with small
children and living in tiny urban homes! It was also around this time that we
came across a disused bowling club and green for sale and saw both the opportunity
that this could provide for both us and the local community and the need to 
protect the space from unwanted development.

In her "normal" life, Kat is a registered veterinary nurse by profession, soon
to be starting a Phd in the field of animal welfare science. Dominic is a
biologist by training, having completed his own Phd studying treatment
resistant breast cancer at the University of Edinburgh.
